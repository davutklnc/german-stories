    "content": "<p>\"You must be Min-ji,\" said the woman at the airport, smiling broadly. \"Welcome to Canada!\"</p>\n\n<p>Min-ji nodded, attempting to mirror the woman's smile despite her exhaustion. The flight from Seoul had been thirteen hours, and she had barely slept. Now she stood in Vancouver International Airport, her life for the next year packed into two suitcases beside her.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm Carol Williams, your host mother,\" the woman continued. \"How was your flight?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"It was... comfortable, thank you,\" Min-ji replied carefully, conscious of her pronunciation. She had studied English for years, but speaking it now, in a real conversation with a native speaker, felt entirely different.</p>\n\n<p>The first few weeks in Vancouver were a whirlwind of new experiences. Min-ji had to adjust to her host family's routines, find her way around a new school system, and navigate cultural differences that textbooks hadn't prepared her for.</p>\n\n<p>\"You should join a club,\" her host father suggested one evening. \"It's a great way to make friends.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I have been thinking about the photography club,\" Min-ji admitted. \"But my English...\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Your English is excellent,\" Carol assured her. \"And photography is a universal language, isn't it?\"</p>\n\n<p>Min-ji had been passionate about photography since middle school. The next day, she gathered her courage and attended the club meeting. She might not understand every word spoken, but she could communicate through her camera.</p>\n\n<p>By October, Min-ji had developed a routine. She had made several friends at school and had even been invited to a Halloween party—something she had only seen in American movies.</p>\n\n<p>\"What should I wear?\" she asked Emma, her closest friend at school.</p>\n\n<p>\"You could dress as something from Korean culture,\" Emma suggested. \"Everyone would love that.\"</p>\n\n<p>Min-ji considered this. \"I would like to try a Western costume,\" she decided. \"I have always wanted to be a superhero.\"</p>\n\n<p>As autumn turned to winter, Min-ji found herself thinking differently about her home country. Distance had given her perspective. She had begun to see aspects of Korean culture that she had previously taken for granted—family dynamics, educational approaches, social expectations—through new eyes.</p>\n\n<p>She had also begun to understand Canadian culture beyond surface stereotypes. The diversity of Vancouver had surprised her; she had expected a certain type of \"Western\" experience, but instead discovered a complex multicultural city.</p>\n\n<p>\"I have learned so much,\" she told her host family over dinner in December. \"Not just about Canada, but about Korea too.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"That's often how it works,\" Carol nodded. \"Sometimes you have to leave a place to really see it clearly.\"</p>\n\n<p>Min-ji knew her exchange year would eventually end. She would return to Korea with improved English skills, of course, but also with something more valuable: a broader perspective on both her host country and her homeland. She had discovered that cultural exchange wasn't just about learning differences—it was about finding unexpected similarities and connections across seemingly distant worlds.</p>"
